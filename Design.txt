Combatizer Design:

We need the following pieces:

V1:

Pieces:
1. Original Utility function V (mapping from world number -> utility)
2. A comparison metric (see paper for examples)
	a. Comparison metric threshold (ex: 0.9, 0.95) 
3. A way to perturb (1) to produce a new utility function U, s.t. comparison(U,V)> threshold
	a. Examples: random noise, swap top actions 
4. An probability distribution on actions/worlds
5. Agents (ex: quantilizer, maximizer, other things) 
6. A way of scoring agents
	a. Designate a particular world as a no-op world => use cost function 
	b. Difference in top actions 

Meta:
a) interface to run things from command line
b) tests 
c) putting results into tables, analysis
d) way to run a giant parameter sweep on everything and look at winners

V2: 
1. Add multiple ways to do 3, while satisfying certain other constraints
2. Have agents take multiple utilities as an input
